/* a) Complete the inigo object by adding a lastName property and including it in the
greeting.
b) Complete getCatchPhrase so that if the person argument has 6 fingers, it instead
prints his famous catch phrase to the console. HINT: see
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/characters/nm0001597.
c) Update getCatchPhrase to use arrow function syntax and a conditional operator. */
